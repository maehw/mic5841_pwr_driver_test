# README

This git repository contains an Arduino sketch which is used to test the 8-bit serial-in latched power driver IC MIC5842.

The specific use case and pinout has been intended for for testing the ["splitflap classic controller"](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap) shield in combination. It's intended to drive motors. In the code it is used in conjunction with an Arduino Leonardo - but it shouldn't be difficult to adapt for other Arduino platforms.
